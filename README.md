## Description

This game is a mix between the classic aracade stacking game and the spinning light game. To play you will stack the lights on both the left and the right side of the arduino. Pressing the button when the purple LED is at the top of the opposite sides stack will add to the stack. You can only stack once on each side per cycle. The goal is to fill the stacks, at which point you will move onto a harder level where the purple LED will move faster and you will be stacking different color lights. After completing 3 levels you beat the game.
